# API-IF
Creating an API of a Finance Institution Simulation

For run that API, you need do two things before:

1. Install some packages in vscode terminal, into the folder of the project, with the command: `bash npm install express mongoose dotenv`
2. Create a file .env into your main folder of the project and add two lines into the file:
```
# Connect with your MongoDB Atlas Database
MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://<user of MongoDB Atlas>:<password of MongoDB Atlas>@<name of your cluster in MongoDB Atlas>.om7hrtp.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<name of your cluster in MongoDB Atlas>
# Choose a number of port to your server
PORT = <port number your server>
```
